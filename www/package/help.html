            <h1>Large Tree Plot</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On many sites, large trees comprise the largest portion of the aboveground biomass, contributing significantly to total ecosystem carbon stocks. These trees also pay a large role in energy flow and nutrient cycling, and provide habitat for many organisms. The Large Tree Plot is established at all ground plot centers for collecting information on all large trees. This information will be used to calculate total volume and gross total biomass, assess site information, and determine site potential. Additional information will be collected to assess forest health.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>To collect details information for large trees (&gE; 9.0 cm at diameter breast height [dbh] to enable the calculation of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>total tree volume (m<sup>3</sup>/ha). Includes aboveground volume inside bark of the main stem, including stump and top of all standing live, fallen live, and dead standing trees;</li>
                <li>total aboveground tree biomass (kg/ha);</li>
                <li>site index for the dominant and co-dominant trees of the major species;</li>
                <li>site age and site height;</li>
                <li>Lorey height;</li>
                <li>annual growth ring width analysis;</li>
                <li>basal area and stem densities for standing live, fallen live, and standing dead trees; and</li>
                <li>various biodiversity indices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p><strong>Tree</strong>: For this inventory, a tree is defined as a woody plant, usually with a single stem and definite crown that can reach a mature height of 5.0 m somewhere within its natural range.</p>
            <p><strong>Dead Tree</strong>: trees that are obviously dead or roots separated from the ground and expected to die very shortly.</p>
            <p><strong>Fallen Trees</strong>: Trees that are not self-supporting.</p>
            <p><strong>Large Tree</strong>: For this inventory, a large tree is a "tree" that is &gE; 1.5t m in height and &gE; 9.0 cm dbh. Large trees include all live standing, live fallen, and dead standing trees.</p>
            <p><strong>Live Tree</strong>: Trees that have enough foliage to keep them alive (live cambium is present), and are rooted into the ground. Lack of foliage for some species, of course, is no indication of death during some seasons.</p>
            <p><strong>Lorey Height</strong>: Lorey's mean height weights the contribution of trees to the stand heigh by their basal area. Thus Lorey's mean height is calculated by multiplying the tree height (h) by its basal area (g), and then dividing the sum of this calculation by the total stand basal area (Brack 1999).</p>
            <p><strong>Site Tree</strong>: Site trees are selected using defined criteria. The selected site trees have a height (called the Site Height) and an age (called the Site Age), which are used to calculate the site index for the stand.</p>
            <p><strong>Standing Tree</strong>: Trees that are self-supporting (i.e., the tree would remain standing if all supporting materials were removed).</p>
            <p><strong> Species</strong>: For this inventory, a tree species is defined as a species listed in Appendix E: NFI - Tree Species List. The species on this list are based on the “tree” definition. Tree species are listed by scientific name; common name; and a code for genus, species, and variety.</p>
            <p>For this inventory, tree species are recorded using accepted standard codes, which generally adhere to the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genus</strong>: Record the genus of each tree using the first four letters of the scientific genus name.</li>
                <li><strong>Species</strong>: Record the species of each tree using the first three letters of the scientific species name.</li>
                <li><strong>Variety</strong>: Record the variety of each tree (if applicable) using the first three letters of the scientific variety name.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: In cases where there the genus/species code combination is the same for more than one tree species, consult Appendix E: NFI - Tree Species List, for the correct code to use.</p>

            <h2>General Procedures</h2>
            <p>Information from field-collected large tree attributes will be used to calculate various values including site index, stand height, basal area by tree status, stem density by tree status, total unique large tree species, crown length, volume, and biomass.</p>
            <p>The procedures within this section are listed as they appear on the field cards but the field crew is free to measure attributes in the most efficient sequence.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Establish and mark the plot circumference.</li>
                <li>Divide the plot into sectors.</li>
                <li>Determine if trees along the plot boundary are in the plot.</li>
                <li>Number the trees in the plot.</li>
                <li>Complete the header information on the field cards.</li>
                <li>Collect the attributes for large trees.</li>
                <li>Determine the site tree selections and collect age data as required.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Completing the Large Tree Details form</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sector</strong>: Record the plot sector. Sectors are numbered consecutively from north (1 to 8). This field is meant to aid field crews in the relocation of large trees in future measurement cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Tree Number</strong>: In a clockwise direction from the north, each tree is assigned a unique number in ascending order. Record the tree number.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Tree </strong> Record the genus of each large tree using the first four letters of the scientific genus name (see Appendix E).</li>
                <li><strong>Large Tree Species</strong>: Record the species of each tree using the first three letters of the scientific species name. Tree genus, species, and variety are recorded only to the level that can be accurately identified with confidence. For example, if the species is not identifiable then only record to the genus level. Use accepted codes for unknown conifers or hardwoods. Field crews should confirm the tree species identification with the ecological sampling crew to ensure the same species are being recorded.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Tree Variety</strong>: If applicable, record the variety of each tree using the first three letters of the scientific variety name. This field may be left blank.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Tree Status Codes</strong>: Record the tree status code that best describes the live or dead large tree. Note that dead fallen trees are not collected in the Large Tree Plot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LS: Live Standing</strong>: Live trees that are self-supporting (i.e., the tree would remain standing if all supporting materials were removed).</li>
                    <li><strong>LF: Live Fallen</strong>: Live trees that are not self-supporting (i.e., the tree would not remain standing if all supporting materials were removed).</li>
                    <li><strong>DS: Dead Standing</strong>: Dead trees that are self-supporting (i.e., the tree would remain standing if all supporting materials were removed).</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>dbh (diameter at breast height) (cm)</strong>: Measure and record the dbh of all large trees (see Appendix J). Diameters should be &gE; 9.0 cm (otherwise it is counted in the Small Tree Plot). Record the dbh to the nearest 0.1 cm.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine high side ground level at the base of the tree. High side is defined as the highest point of mineral soil or a humus layer around the base of the tree, no lower than the point of germination. Breast height is 1.3 m above high side measured parallel to the tree bole.</li>
                    <li>Use a stake marked at 1.3 m to accurately locate dbh on straight stems. On curved stems, measure along the curve parallel to the center of the tree.</li>
                    <li>Mark a point on the tree where dbh is to be measured, preferably facing the plot center (use a felt pen, small paint dot, or lightly scribe bark).</li>
                    <li>If there is an obstruction at the dbh level (such as large branches, forked stem, or large scar tissue), measure above and below the obstruction and estimate dbh at 1.3 m.</li>
                    <li>Measure the dbh with a tight diameter tape, outside the bark, making no allowance for missing bark.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Measured or Estimated dbh</strong>: Record whether the dbh was measured (M) or estimated (E).</li>
                <li><strong>Tree Height (m)</strong>: Measure the height of each large tree within the Large Tree Plot, including broken and live fallen trees. Measure all trees except where the measurement is physically obstructed, where it is unsafe to make the measurement, or when an accurate measurement is impossible. In such cases, estimate the tree height.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Measure the height of the tree from the ground level on the high side along the stem to the top of the stem. Record height to the nearest 0.1 m.</li>
                    <li>For broken stems, measure the height to the midpoint of the break.</li>
                    <li>For trees with a noticeable lean, calculate the height of the tree (C). Measure horizontally the distance (A) from the base of the tree to a point directly under the top of the tree. Measure the height (B) from the end of length A to the top of the tree. Using the following formula, calculate the height of the tree (C):</li>
                    C = &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">(A2 + B2)</span>
                    <li>If a tree height has to be estimated, check the accuracy of your estimations by comparing the estimated tree height against measured adjacent heights.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Measured, Calculated, or Estimated Height: Record whether the tree height was measured by field crew (M); calculated, usually from height diameter curves (C); or estimated by field crew (E).</li>
                <li>Crown Class: Crown class is a ranking by crown position of a tree in relation to other trees in the immediate area surrounding the tree being measured. The crown class is used in the selection of site trees on the plot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assign a crown class code to all large trees using the descriptions in Table 12.2.</li>
                    <li>For trees with broken or dead tops, assess the remaining live portion of the crown relative to its present interception of light in the immediate area around the measured tree. For example, a tree was formerly in a dominant crown position but the top of the crown has died back and only the lower limbs are alive. This crown would most likely be ranked in the intermediate or suppressed position based on the current light interception of the remaining crown. If the broken or dead top has resulted in a missing crown, the crown class should be coded as “N” (not applicable).</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Azimuth to Tree (&deg;)</strong>: Stem mapping is used to relocate the plot center and to aid in ongoing measurement. Ideally, all large trees in a plot would be stem mapped, but this is left as optional for the NFI plots.<br/>
                    For stem-mapped trees, measure and record the azimuth from the plot center pin to the face of the tree (to the nearest degree).<br/>
                    <strong><em>Note</em></strong>: A minimum of 3-5 trees surrounding the plot center should be stem mapped to relocate the plot center pin in future measurements. These trees should be located in a triangular formation around the plot center. Insert a nail in the selected trees to be stem mapped near ground level. Measure from this nail to the plot center pin and record the distance and bearing to the plot center.

                <li>Damage Agents: Assess all large trees, dead or alive, within the Large Tree Plot for damage agent(s). Damage agents are frequently associated with decay, rot in the wood, or factors affecting overall tree vigor. They may include non-biological (abiotic) injuries, disease, insects, treatment injuries, and animal damage. Refer to Table 12.5 for a comprehensive list of codes and descriptions of damage agents.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Record the damage agent(s) for each tree.</li>
                    <li>Record “O” if no damage agent is observed.</li>
                    <li>When the tree has more than two damage agents, list the most important two damage agents.</li>
                    <li>In many cases, damage such as forks and scars may be evident but the damage agent is not known. In these instances, record a “U” in the damage agent field</li>
