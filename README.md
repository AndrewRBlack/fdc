is a mobile data collection project that myself and two other developers worked on for the Pacific Forestry Centre & National Forest Information System in Victoria, BC. It was built as a prototype to demonstrate the capabilities of data collection and validation on Android using the HTML5-based platform, Cordova. I was entirely responsible for the Javascript code which can be seen in the "www/index.html" and "www/package/package.js" files which make extensive use of JQuery and other JS packages. I coded much of the front-end and JSON content as well. To test, run the index.html file on a webserver to use the application. Clicking "Load Test Package" will provide a link to the "Large Tree Plot" sample form in menu located at the top left corner of the page.
